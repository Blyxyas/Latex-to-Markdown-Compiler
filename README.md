# Latex to Markdown Compiler

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blyxyas/Latex-to-Markdown-Compiler/master/images/logo.png" />
This is a latex to markdown compiler.

## Usage

Open the target file, open the command palette (With *<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>* In Windows & Linux, or *<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>* for MacOS), and select Search for **`Compile Latex`**. That's it! It will replace all you latex formulas with the HTML tags that will render them.

## Features

<small>(All this formulas were compiled using the compiler)</small>
Use `$` to open an inline math formula. Like this!

(View the source for this formulas in the [Latex file](https://github.com/Blyxyas/Latex-to-Markdown-Compiler/blob/master/formulas.tex))

This is an inline formula <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\bbox[%230d1117]{\color{%23fff}{E%3Dmc%5E2}}" /> which means that I can keep writing in this line.

You can also use `$$` to open a block math formula.

The blocks are centered and are rendered with a `h3` tag.
